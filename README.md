## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://dlmocha.com/GameImages/GameRepoIMG/gogoMocha.png)

This is the first online game that I made and published. The name is inspired by the iconic game Super Mario. In the game, you will be a cat trying to pass all obstacles and rescue the kittens. My friend provided me with the cat and mouse UX model to implement. The function of the game I coded includes basic movement(up, down, right, left arrow) and jump(space) along with some physical effects in Unity interacts with the Rigidbody of the character and enemies.
